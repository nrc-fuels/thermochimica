THERMOCHIMICA [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ORNL-CEES/thermochimica.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ORNL-CEES/thermochimica)
=============

THERMOCHIMICA is a computational library for chemical thermodynamics.
It determines a unique combination of phases and their compositions
for a prescribed chemical composition, temperature and pressure. The
solver and the underlying thermodynamic models can be used to estimate
the chemical state and various constitutive and transport properties
necessary for modeling of materials and processes.
